# experimental code
As far as porting of MOSES to MeTTa goes, this is where I put anything that I experiment with.

Type definitions, functions, and more functions and even more functions and what not goes in here.

# TODO's 
Contain code yet to be done or that needs some correcting

Dont be surprised if you see sth that dont make any sense at all either.
